# Introduction to Self-Driving Cars

This is repository to capture my personal notes from the coursera's course
[Introdution to Self-Driving Cars](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-self-driving-cars?=).

The main objective with this course is the use of the CARLA Simulator. The final project for this
course is heavily based on this simulator. Hence, it is crucial to properly set-up.
